India is erecting a new non-cut 'steel fence' to plug vulnerable and infiltration-prone patches along its
sensitive border with Pakistan. They said the single-row fence, with loops of concertina wires on top, is
being erected at a 60-km border stretch in near Amritsar in Punjab. This fence will cost about Rs 2 crore
for a kilometre, official sources said.
Based on the feedback of these projects, new fence will be erected at more places where either the old one
has worn out or there was no fence owing to geographical challenges.
The sources informed that the Union home ministry has also advanced a technology-based project of deploying
'laser fences' along these two borders, to five years as compared to the earlier 10-year deadline.
The Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS) that entails deployment of smart fences, 
advanced surveillance gadgets and anti-infiltration alarms has been speeded up by the border management
division under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and Border Security Force along these two borders.
